(local-date-time 1986 10) (local-date-time 1986 9))\ntrue\n```\n\n  Often you will want to find a date some amount of time from a given date. For\n  example, to find the time 1 month and 3 weeks from a given date-time:\n\n```clojure\n=> (plus (date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))\n#<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>\n\n=> (plus (local-date-time 1986 10 14) (months 1) (weeks 3))\n#<DateTime 1986-12-05T00:00:00.000Z>\n```\n\n  An Interval is used to represent the span of time between two DateTime\n  instances. Construct one using interval, then query them using within?,\n  overlaps?, and abuts?\n\n```clojure\n=> (within? (interval (date-time 1986) (date-time 1990)) (date-time 1987))\ntrue\n```\n\n  To find the amount of time encompased by an interval, use in-seconds and\n  in-minutes:\n\n```clojure\n=> (in-minutes (interval (date-time 1986 10 2) (date-time 1986 10 14)))\n17280\n```\n\n  Note that all functions in this namespace work with Joda objects or ints.
