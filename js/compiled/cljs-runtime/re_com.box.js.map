based on the :size parameter.\n   IMPORTANT: The term 'size' means width of the item in the case of flex-direction 'row' OR height of the item in the case of flex-direction 'column'.\n   Flex property explanation:\n    - grow    Integer ratio (used with other siblings) to determined how a flex item grows it's size if there is extra space to distribute. 0 for no growing.\n    - shrink  Integer ratio (used with other siblings) to determined how a flex item shrinks it's size if space needs to be removed. 0 for no shrinking.\n    - basis   Initial size (width, actually) of item before any growing or shrinking. Can be any size value, e.g. 60%, 100px, auto\n              Note: auto will cause the initial size to be calculated to take up as much space as possible, in conjunction with it's siblings :flex settings.\n   Supported values:\n    - initial            '0 1 auto'  - Use item's width/height for dimensions (or content dimensions if w/h not specifed). Never grow.
